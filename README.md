index.js

The provided Node.js code uses the `fs` (File System) module to handle file operations. First, `fs.writeFileSync('hello.txt', 'Hello from Node.js!')` creates a file named `hello.txt` and writes the text "Hello from Node.js!" into it. If the file already exists, this function overwrites its content. Next, `fs.appendFileSync('hello.txt', 'Hello again!')` appends the text "Hello again!" to the existing content of the file. As a result, the final content of `hello.txt` becomes "Hello from Node.js!Hello again!".

app.js

The provided Node.js code demonstrates the concept of asynchronous behavior and the event loop. 

When the code is executed, the output will be:

```
Strated
End
After 0 sec
after 2 sec
```

### Explanation:

1. **`console.log('Strated');`** is executed first as it's a synchronous operation, so "Strated" is printed.

2. **`setTimeout(() => { console.log('after 2 sec'); }, 2000);`** schedules a callback to be executed after 2 seconds. However, it doesn't block the execution of the next lines.

3. **`setTimeout(() => { console.log('After 0 sec'); }, 0);`** schedules a callback with a delay of 0 milliseconds. However, it is placed in the event queue and waits for the current execution stack to complete.

4. **`console.log('End');`** is executed immediately as it's synchronous.

5. After the current stack finishes, the event loop picks the `setTimeout` with 0 seconds and executes "After 0 sec".

6. Finally, after 2 seconds, the second `setTimeout` callback runs, printing "after 2 sec".

This behavior occurs due to Node.js's event loop and asynchronous handling.
