index.js

The provided Node.js code uses the `fs` (File System) module to handle file operations. First, `fs.writeFileSync('hello.txt', 'Hello from Node.js!')` creates a file named `hello.txt` and writes the text "Hello from Node.js!" into it. If the file already exists, this function overwrites its content. Next, `fs.appendFileSync('hello.txt', 'Hello again!')` appends the text "Hello again!" to the existing content of the file. As a result, the final content of `hello.txt` becomes "Hello from Node.js!Hello again!".
